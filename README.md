## About the Video Course
Friends, please take the time to review the curriculum carefully before buying so you can see exactly whether this is the right course for you. Please watch the free preview videos so you can see whether the presentation style works for you. Please remember I am just one person, and I make my videos often after I have been working for many hours already. You are interested in real coding. You enjoy detailed explanations. You can take videos that are 13 minutes on average. You enjoy seeing how different technologies interact. You understand that most of the SQL is done in the Microsoft Management Studio, and not Visual Studio. You're not looking for fancy graphics, a talking head, or entertainment. You're looking for practical, carefully explained examples, where the code is written line by line. If you use SQL Server versions below 2014, some of the code will not work. You must use versions 2014 and above. This course uses ASP.NET, and not MVC.
